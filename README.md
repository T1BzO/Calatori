# Calatori

## Overview

**Calatori** is a programming project that explores concepts in both **C++** and **Kotlin**. The project contains implementations of solutions related to transportation (trains) and potentially exercises in Kotlin for learning or demonstrating specific functionality.

### Contents

- **`tren.cpp`**: A C++ program focused on modeling and simulating train-related operations, such as routes, schedules, or passenger management. [Please expand if more details are available.]
- **`exercitiul_in_kotlin.kt`**: A Kotlin script that demonstrates a specific exercise or implementation. It may focus on object-oriented programming, data structures, or problem-solving. [Please add more specific details if known.]

## Features

- **C++ Implementation**: Includes a program (`tren.cpp`) that demonstrates key programming concepts such as:
  - Handling input and output.
  - Simulating real-world processes related to transportation.
  - Possible integration of algorithms for optimization.

- **Kotlin Exercise**: A concise Kotlin program (`exercitiul_in_kotlin.kt`) showcasing modern programming techniques such as:
  - Functional programming.
  - Handling lists, maps, or other collections.
  - Kotlin-specific syntax and features.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to compile and run the programs included in the repository.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **For C++**:
  - GCC (`g++`) or another modern C++ compiler.
- **For Kotlin**:
  - Kotlin compiler (`kotlinc`) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

### Setup Instructions

#### Running `tren.cpp` (C++)

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `tren.cpp`.
2. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o tren tren.cpp
